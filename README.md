This repo extends the React, Tailwind, Supabase & Vite template to include E2E Tests.

Run using the `npn run test-e2e` command & then non e2e tests with `npm run test`

At the moment due to an issue with jest and jest-chrome versions deps need to be installed with --force e.g `npm install --force`.
